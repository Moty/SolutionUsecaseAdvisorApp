# Instructions to Install Tesseract OCR on Windows 11

To enable Tesseract OCR for text extraction in your project, please follow the steps below to install Tesseract on your Windows 11 system:

## Step 1: Download the Tesseract Installer

1. **Visit the Official Tesseract Repository:**
   - Navigate to the [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) GitHub page. This repository provides the latest Windows installers maintained by the University of Mannheim.

2. **Download the Installer:**
   - On the GitHub page, locate the latest stable release of the Tesseract installer (e.g., `tesseract-5.3.0-win64.exe`).
   - Click on the installer link to download it to your computer.

## Step 2: Run the Installer

1. **Execute the Installer:**
   - Locate the downloaded installer file (`tesseract-5.3.0-win64.exe`) in your `Downloads` folder or the directory you chose.
   - Double-click the installer to run it.

2. **Follow Installation Prompts:**
   - **License Agreement:** Read and accept the license agreement to proceed.
   - **Choose Installation Directory:**
     - The default installation path is typically `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`. You can leave it as is or choose a different directory.
   - **Select Components:**
     - Ensure that the option to add Tesseract to your system's PATH is checked. This allows you to run Tesseract commands from any command prompt.

3. **Complete Installation:**
   - Click `Install` and wait for the installation process to complete.
   - Once finished, click `Finish`.

## Step 3: Verify Tesseract Installation

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter` to open the Command Prompt.

2. **Check Tesseract Version:**
   - In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```
     tesseract --version
     ```
   - You should see output similar to:
     ```
     tesseract v5.3.0
     leptonica-1.82.0
     libgif 5.1.9 : libjpeg 9c : libpng 1.6.37 : libtiff 4.3.0 : zlib 1.2.11
     Found AVX2
     Found AVX
     Found FMA
     Found SSE4.1
     Found SSE4.2
     ```

## Step 4: Restart VSCode (If Open)

- If you had Visual Studio Code or any other IDE open during the installation, close and reopen it to ensure that the system recognizes the new PATH settings.

## Step 5: Re-run the Special Test Script

1. **Execute the Test Script:**
   - Open your terminal in VSCode.
   - Navigate to your project directory if not already there:
     ```
     cd c:/Users/I851396/OneDrive - SAP SE/My Documents/___SAP IE Architect/__Code/UseCaseWebapp
     ```
   - Run the test script:
     ```
     node backend/testFieldServiceQuotesSpecial.js
     ```

2. **Review Test Results:**
   - After the script completes, provide the contents of `backend/fieldServiceQuotesSpecialResult.txt` to verify if the similarity score has improved.

## Additional Notes

- **Environment Variables:**
  - If you did not add Tesseract to your system's PATH during installation, you can manually add it:
    1. **Open System Properties:**
       - Press `Win + X` and select `System`.
    2. **Advanced System Settings:**
       - Click on `Advanced system settings`.
    3. **Environment Variables:**
       - In the `System Properties` window, click on `Environment Variables`.
    4. **Edit PATH:**
       - Under `System variables`, find and select the `Path` variable, then click `Edit`.
    5. **Add Tesseract Path:**
       - Click `New` and add the path to the Tesseract installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`).
    6. **Save Changes:**
       - Click `OK` on all open dialogs to save the changes.

By following these steps, Tesseract OCR should be successfully installed and integrated into your project environment, enabling effective text extraction from PDF files.
